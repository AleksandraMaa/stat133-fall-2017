# Frequently Asked Questions about Stat 133

Below are some of the questions I get asked everytime I teach Stat 133.
Do you really need to read them? Not really, but if you ever ask me a 
question that it's here, I'm going to kindly ask you to refer to this document.


### Is this course a good fit if I don't have any programming experience?

Yes. We actually expect that most of you come without any coding experience.
It is nice to have some programming experience under your belt, which makes 
the learning curve less steep.


### Is this course a good fit if I've already taken at least one programming course?

You may find the majority of this course somewhat slow (and boring?) in terms 
of basics concepts such as data types, data structures, conditionals, loops, 
and functions. Please consider taking more advanced courses if what you are 
interested in is in algorithms, computational statistics, or data bases.


### Is this course a good fit if I don't have any data analysis experience?

Yes. We actually expect that most of you come without any data analysis experience.
In this course you will be working with real data sets, as well as with 
simulated data.


### After finishing this course, can I call myself a data scientist?

No. Becoming a data scientist is not a sprint. It is a marathon. Like any other 
profession, it takes years of practice and learning. This course is just the beginning.


### What if I don't want to be a data scientist?

That's perfect too. You don't need to be a data scientist wannabe to take this course.
Whether your plans are to be a consultant, life scientist, social scientist, 
journalist, or get some analytic skills, this course should be a good choice.


### Are we going to learn about machine learning methods?

No. This course is not about machine learning (or statistical learning) methods.
The Statistics department offers a dedcidated course on this topic: 
__Stat 154: Modern Statistical Prediction and Machine Learning__.
There is also __CS 189: Introduction to Machine Learning__ offered through 
Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS).


### Are we going to learn about data bases?

No. If you are interested in Databases you should consider 
__CS 186: Introduction to Database Systems__ offered through 
Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS).


### Are we going to learn about linear models?

No. The course for linear models is __Stat 151A: Linear Modeling, Theory and Applications__.


### Are we going to learn about Reproducible Research (RR)?

Not really. We will touch on dynamic documents and practices that are useful 
in RR, but the dedicated course for this topic is 
__Stat 159: Reproducible and Collaborative Statistical Data Science__.


### Do we need to memorize all commands?

No. We don't expect that you memorize all commands. However, we do expect that 
you learn the most common types of functions: `library()`, `function()`, etc.


### Are we going to learn how to create an R package?

No. Unfortunately, this is out of the scope of the course. But if some of you 
are really interested in creating a basic package, we can try to organize some 
sort of workshop for that purpose.


### Can we work in groups?

Yes, absolutely. We strongly encourage you to not work alone. Well, let me rephrase that.
You should try to work on your own. Experimenting, trial and error. Take notes 
of the things you don't understand. Then get with other people and discuss ideas, 
share tips (but not the entire solution). Try to explain how some piece of code 
works to your friend(s).


### Aren't you suppose to teach us?

Yes. But you don't learn programming by watching someone else program.
The same way that you don't learn to swim by watching someone else swimming.
You have to get into the pool, and do all the drills your instructor says.
This is a very hands-on course, and you will be required to do a great amount
of work on your own.


### Can I ask you to write me a Letter of Recommendation (LoR)?

Quick answer: No. However, I am happy to write you a letter of recommendation 
if I have known you for at least one year, and as long as we have developed 
a good collegial relationship (e.g. I know your name, I know your personal story, 
you've shown interest in my work).
Getting a "good grade" does not guarantee that I will write you a LoR. Conversely,
getting a "not so good grade" does not have to be an impediment to write you a LoR.


### I invited you to join my network in LinkedIn. Why haven't you accepted it?

First: Don't take it personal. It's not you, it's me. Second: if you really 
want me to be part of your network, why don't you come see me in person? 
We can meet in OH, we can talk right before or after class. Or you can also
schedule a meeting at a different time. Let me know you better than just as 
a distant contact in a social media networking site.


### Do you have research projects open to undergrad students?

Lecturing takes most of my time and I don't a lab. However, I'm always coming up 
with new ideas and experiments, and it's nice to have additional human resources 
to create something useful, interesting, open (and cool). If you are 
interested in volunteering and willing to learn a lot, come talk to me and 
let's see if we can join forces, and add our two cents to the world.
