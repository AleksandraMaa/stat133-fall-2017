## Posts

In addition to the HW assignments, you will have to write three __posts__.
The idea of a post is to do some research on a topic from the syllabus, and write a report in the form of a blog post.


### Post Topics

You will have to write three posts based on three of the five major course themes
(you could also write a post with a mix of the themes):

+ Data Visualization
+ Data Manipulation (reshaping, wrangling, formatting, tidying)
+ Programming for data analysis
+ Data Technologies
+ Reporting Tools


Each post should target a specific topic. For instance, say you choose Data Visualization as the theme for your first post. Specifically, say you will talk about how to make pie-charts in R. We don't want you to simply copy-paste the resources you find out there (stackoverflow, R-bloggers, etc). Instead, we want you to do an extensive research, gathering enough information and sources, summarize what you've learned, and showing us insteresting examples.

Some questions to keep in mind (not an extensive list):

- Why is it important?
- How other users can benefit from it?
- Are there any limitations?
- Do you need specific packages?
- Where can you find more information?
- Where can you find other examples?

If you find hard to come up with a topic, feel free to ask the instructor or any GSI for suggestions or inspiration.

With a class as big as Stat 133, it is possible that two or more students choose the same topic. In theory, there is no problem with repeating topics. We expect that each person writes a unique report. Plagiarism will not be tolerated.



### Format and Style

- You are free to write the post in any style you want. However, regardless of the chosen style, you should write the report WITH YOUR OWN WORDS.
- If your writing skills are "limited", we recommend writing the post as a tutorial. 
- Keep an ideal reader in mind when writing the post. Preferably, that ideal reader should be you.
- You can also pretend that your audience are other Stat 133 students (the instructor is NOT your audience).
- If you are writing the post with a very specific type of reader in mind, then please mention your assumptions about who the content is targeted to.
- You should submit your post to your github repository for Stat 133 HWs.
- Perhaps the simplest format for a post is using an Rmd file that generates output as a `github_document`.
- But you could also include supporting material (e.g. slides, scripts, shiny app).



### Grading of Posts

Each of your posts not only will be assessed by one of the staff members, but it also will be peer-reviewed by at least two students from your lab section who will provide a constructive critique.

Each post will be graded on the following criteria:

- __Originality__: Content of the post is original (material not covered in lecture/lab/assignments, or material extended on what has been covered).
- __Application__: One ore more examples illustrating the applicability of the discussed topic(s).
- __Verbal__: Communicate descriptions and findings in writing clearly, precisely, and concisely.
- __Visual__: Communicate key concepts and findings graphically, clearly, and precisely.
- __Coding__: Clean, well-formatted, easily readable code.
- __References__: Comprehensive list of sources and references.



### Mastery-Oriented

Please keep in mind that posts are mastery-oriented goals, not performance-oriented.

__Mastery__ is a desire to acquire additional knowledge or master new skills. It also encompasses developing new skills, improving or developing competence, trying to accomplish something challenging and trying to gain an understanding or insight.

__Performance__ is a desire to demonstrate high ability and make a good impression. It typically represents a focus on demonstrating competence or ability, and how ability will be judged relative to others---and usually attempting to best others.


With performance-oriented goals, you are being judged agaist everybody else. You want to make a good impression and be judged competent---even if you don't master any of the fundamental concepts.

With mastery-oriented goals, you are competing against yourself, with the goal of understanding and learning new skills. How much you learn depends on you, on what was your previous knowledge base, and how far you're willing to go outside of your comfort zone.
