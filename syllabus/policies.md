## Stat 133 Course Logistics and Policies


### Labs

- Lab discussion is an important part of the class and is meant to supplement lecture.
- You must attend the discussion group you are officially registered in.
- You will be encouraged to problem solve individually or in groups.
- Weekly labs are a required part of the course and should be submitted during your lab session.
- To receive credit, you must attend lab, work on the lab assignment until you're finished or the lab period is over, and get checked off by a course staff member. 
- Labs will be released on Monday night. If you don't want to attend lab physically, you may complete a lab assignment remotely, but you must complete it by Tuesday at 11:59pm to receive credit. 
- Note that if you attend lab, you can still get credit even if you don't finish all of the lab problems. However, if you choose to work remotely, you must finish the entire lab to receive credit. 
- Each person must submit each lab independently, but you are welcome to collaborate with other students in your lab room.
- There will be about 4/5 short quizzes given in discussion to test your understanding.
- Your quiz scores __will NOT__ be part of your grade.



### Homework Assignments

- Homework assignments will be assigned almost every two weeks (about 5/6 HW).
- You will submit your homework via bCourses electronically (as a word, text, pdf, or html file).
- I will drop your lowest HW score.
- Don't wait until the last hour to do an assignment. Plan ahead and pace yourself.
- Don't wait until the last minute to submit your assignment.
- __No late assignments__ will be accepted, for any reason, including, but not 
limited to, Internet congestion, system crashes, natural disasters, 
theft, medical emergencies, personal crisis,theft or any extraordinary 
circumnstances (e.g. illnes, exhaustion, mourning, loss of internet connection, bCourses is down, broken computer). Don't ask. I won't be sympathetic. 
Plan ahead and pace yourself.
- The homework assignments will get substantially more difficult as we
progress with the course.
- If you collaborate with other students when working on a HW assignment, please include the names of those students in your submission.
- You must write your own answers (using your own words). Copy and plagiarism will not be tolerated (see _Academic Honesty_ policy).



### Exams

- There will be one 50-minute in-class midterm, and one 3-hour final exam.
- The tentative date of the midterm is TBD. 
- The final exam is currently scheduled for Day, Dec ddth from time1 to time2. (classroom to be announced).
- If you do not take the final, you will NOT pass the class.
- There will be __no early or makeup exams__.
- Do not take the class if you are not available at these dates and times.
- To ask for regrading, you must answer a test using pen. Tests answered with pencil will not be accepted for regrading.
- When asking for regrading, please clearly state the reasons that make you think you deserve a higher score.
- In case of regrading, I (Gaston Sanchez) will regrade your entire test.



### Grading Structure

- 10% labs
- 30% homework
- 10% midterm
- 30% final project
- 20% final 

No individual letter grades will be given for midterm, or final. You will get a letter grade for the course that is based on your overall score. Your final grade will be graded on a 30/30/30/10 (A/B/C/DF) scale.



### Learning Cooperatively

With the obvious exception of exams, we encourage you to discuss all of the course activities with your friends and classmates as you are working on them. You will definitely learn more in this class if you work with others than if you do not. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally.

Since you're working collaboratively, keep your project partner and the course staff informed. If some medical or personal emergency takes you away from the course for an extended period, or if you decide to drop the course for any reason, please don't just disappear silently! You should inform your project partner, so that nobody is depending on you to do something you can't finish.



### Academic Honesty

Cooperation has a limit, however. You should not share your code or answers directly with other students. Doing so doesn't help them; it just sets them up for trouble on exams. Feel free to discuss the problems with others beforehand, but not the solutions. Please complete your own work and keep it to yourself. The exception to this rule is that you can share everything related to a project with your project partner and turn in one project between you.

I (Gaston Sanchez) expect you to do your own work and to uphold the standards of intellectual integrity. Collaborating on homework is fine and I encourage you to work together---but copying is not, nor is having somebody else submit assignments for you. Cheating will not be tolerated. Anyone found cheating will receive an F and will be reported to the [Center for the Student Conduct](http://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct). If you are having trouble with an assignment or studying for an exam, or if you are uncertain about permissible and impermissible conduct or collaboration, please come see me with your questions. 

Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in this course! The course staff is here to help you succeed. If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the projects, you won't need to copy any answers.



### Email Policy

- You should try to use email as a tool to set up a one-on-one meeting with me if office hours conflict with your schedule.
- Use the subject line __Stat 133 Meeting Request__.
- Your message should include at least two times when you would like to meet and a brief (one-two sentence) description of the reason for the meeting.
- Do NOT expect me to reply right away (I may not reply on time).
- If you have an emergency, talk to me later during class or office hours.
- I strongly encourage you to ask questions about the syllabus, covered material, and assignments during class time or lab discussions. 
- I prefer to have conversations in person rather than via email, thus allowing us to get to know each other better and fostering a more collegial learning atmosphere.



### Accommodation Policy

Students needing accommodations for any physical, psychological, or learning disability, should speak with me during the first two weeks of the semester, either after class or during office hours and see [http://dsp.berkeley.edu](http://dsp.berkeley.edu) to learn about Berkeleyâ€™s policy. If you are a DSP student, please contact me at least three weeks prior to a midterm or final so that we can work out acceptable accommodations via the DSP Office.

If you are an athlete or Cal band member, please check your calendar and come see me as soon as possible to OH during the first two weeks of the semester. Do not take the class if you are not available to take the midterm, final, and/or attend lab discussions. I won't be able to provide accommodation for a late exam (No coaching staff proctoring).



### Safe, Supportive, and Inclusive Environment

Whenever a faculty member, staff member, post-doc, or GSI is responsible for 
the supervision of a student, a personal relationship between them of a 
romantic or sexual nature, even if consensual, is against university policy. 
Any such relationship jeopardizes the integrity of the educational process.

Although faculty and staff can act as excellent resources for students, you 
should be aware that they are required to report any violations of this campus 
policy. If you wish to have a confidential discussion on matters related to this 
policy, you may contact the _Confidential Care Advocates_ on campus for support 
related to counseling or sensitive issues. Appointments can be
made by calling (510) 642-1988.

The classroom, lab, and work place should be safe and inclusive environments 
for everyone. The _Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination_ 
(OPHD) is responsible for ensuring the University provides an environment for 
faculty, staff and students that is free from discrimination and harassment on 
the basis of categories including race, color, national origin, age, sex, gender, 
gender identity, and sexual orientation. Questions or concerns? 
Call (510) 643-7985, email ask_ophd@berkeley.edu, or go to 
[http://survivorsupport.berkeley.edu/](http://survivorsupport.berkeley.edu/).



### Incomplete Policy

Under emergency/special circumstances, students may petition me to receive an Incomplete grade. By University policy, for a student to get an Incomplete requires (i) that the student was performing __passing-level work__ until the time that (ii) something happened that---through no fault of the student---prevented the student from completing the coursework. If you take the final, you completed the course, even if you took it while ill, exhausted, mourning, etc. The time to talk to me about incomplete grades is BEFORE you take the final, when the situation that prevents you from finishing presents itself. Please clearly state your reasoning in your comments to me.

It is your responsibility to develop good time management skills, good studying habits, know your limits, and learn to ask for professional help.
Life happens. Social, family, cultural, scholar, and individual circumstances can affect your performance (both positive and negatively). If you find yourself in a situation that raises concerns about passing the course, please come see me as soon as possible. Above all, please do not wait till the end of the semester to share your concerns about passing the course because it will be too late by then.



### Letters of Recommendation

Unless I have known you at least one year, and we have developed a good collegial relationship, I do not provide letters of recommendation. 



### Additional Course Policies

- Be sure to pay attention to deadlines.
- In consideration to everybody in the classroom, please turn off your cell phone during class and lab time.



### Fine Print

The course deadlines, assignments, exam times and material are subject to change at the whim of the professor.
