HW00 - Stat 133, Fall 2017
================

The purpose of this assignment is to work with an `Rmd` file and practice writing content using markdown syntax.

You will be using R markdown files, aka `Rmd` files, throughout the rest of the course. So the sooner you get familiar with the markdown syntax, the better. Hopefully, after finishing the course, you will ditch (or at least minimize the use of) office-like software and switch to a combination of markdown file(s)---with R or other compatible software---to make your assignments or prepare any other type of document.

Although this HW is a dummy assignment, please take it as an inexpensive opportunity to tackle any logistic problems, and make sure R, RStudio, bCourses, Git, Github, and your computer work nicely---without being penalized.

### Quadratic Equation

Visit the wikipedia page for the quadratic equation: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation>

Write the general form of a quadratic equation, and provide a brief description for it. Also, write the quadratic formula for the roots of the general quadratic equation.

### Comments on this assignment

Reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc. What things were hard, even though you saw them in class? What was easy(-ish) even though we haven't done it in class?
